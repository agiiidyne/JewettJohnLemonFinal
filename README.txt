TEAM: Reagan Jewett, Noel De La Cruz, and Shaun Feagles


MODIFICATIONS:
Upon pressing enter, John Lemon gains a speed boost for a few seconds. There is a circle in the bottom left corner of the screen that fills up once the boost is ready to be used again, and once you use the boost it drops to empty to signify when you can next boost.

Also, the movement speed and paths of some of the ghosts were adjusted, as well as adding a few ghosts here and there. The camera angle was also adjusted as well as adding a few post-processing features. //this was done by another team member, but they were still modifications made to the project.

BIGGEST CHALLENGE:
The biggest challenge for me was figuring out how to make the UI graphic for the speed boost recharge. I managed to figure out the speed boost itself very quickly, but the UI recharge took me hours! I'm satisfied with how it came together, though.

CONTINUE WORKING?:
I'm happy with how the game ended up, but I wouldn't mind coming back to add some features we wanted to add/change but couldn't find the time. Things like fixing the animation for the ghosts or being able to make John Lemon freeze upon getting close to a ghost.
